Here I want to test Landsat2 and Sentinel8 multispectral observations from space to analyze vegetation health and droughness in region under water stress. The region taken is approximatively Andalousia (Spain)

This is my first project using google earth engine, so I have some issues, but figures are for now encouraging. Mains issues are :
1) same vegetation index give different figure for Landsat and for Sentinel. Reason is unclear.
2) I struggle to save figure locally on my computer, when i run the code from my computer, so I made a .ipynb file on google colab, mainly for vizualisation (can't save locally)
3) When I compare times series for the same location, Sentinel have a lot of NaN. It is not specific to the NDVI index shown. 

However, potential are really huge here. One could try to study desertification processes in past years, or 2024 flood near Malaga
